Models
M1 - Preprocessing and Identification
M10 - Document language identification
M11 - Recognizes the contract type
M12 - Document extraction and division into lines
M13 - Extracts all legal references


M2 - Analysis and Evaluation
M21 - Analization model, formatting
M22 - Analization model, general eval
M23 - Analization model, general eval
M24 - Analization model, general eval
M25 - Analization model, small things
M26 - Checks the legal references one by one
M27 - If a legal reference has problems, it suggests a better one
M28 - Summarizes the analization models

M3 - User Output
M30 - Does the full user output

M4 - Post-Output Checks
M40 - does a check on M3's output, currently off

M5 - Output Translation
M50 - Translates M3's output, using M10's output

The output of M50 will be delivered to the user.

Version History
Contra MV0.03
Bug fixes, added new models: M13, M26, M27 for legal reference validations and suggestions. It now only prints out the correct variables for the user deployment. 

Contra MV0.04
New prompts still made by chatgpt, but now an enhanced version (done with gpt-4.1). temporarly disabled the usage of guides, to save tokens and as they await rewriting
 Due to tokenlimit getting hit for some reason, m26 and m27 now don’t execute paralell, rather they run linear (temporarly)
